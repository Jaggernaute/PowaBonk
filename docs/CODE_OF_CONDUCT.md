# Code of Conduct

Everyone that interacts with the PowaBonk project is expected to follow those   
guidelines:
1. Use the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system and a unix makefile to execute all commands.
2. Use the Ninja compiler.
3. Make sure to separate logic from UI.
4. Follow the LLVM cpp [style guide](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html).
5. Try to avoid CLang tidy warnings (some rules contradicts each others so try to   
   avoid them but use some common sense).
4. try to avoid using [Qt's](https://www.qt-project.org/) non-standard features.
5. 5. use c++23 or higher(when it'll be released).
6. please respect the architecture of the project :
    ```  
    .  
    |--include  
    |--libs  
    |--ressources  
    |  |--css  
    |  |--images  
    |  `--.env  
    |--src  
    `--tests  
    ```  

And in general, everyone is expected to be **open**,  
**considerate**, and **respectful** of others no matter what their position is  
within the project.
