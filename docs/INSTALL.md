## Install Maria DB

Now you have to install and create the database.
You are going to install Maria DB, the implementation of MySQL for Arch Linux

```sh
pacman -S mariadb libmariadbclient mariadb-clients
```

After installation, you have to set some base configuration with this command.
```sh
mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
```

As you guess, you need to start and enable the service.
```sh
systemctl start mysqldsystemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld
```
execute the seed file.
```sh
mysql -uroot -h127.0.0.1 < [powabonk-dir]/resources/seed.sql
```

you have to set the root password and some other configurations. You can do it with this command

```sh
mysql_secure_installation
```
